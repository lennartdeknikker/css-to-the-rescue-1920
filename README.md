# Climbing the Mount Everest

As an assignment for the course [css to the rescue](https://github.com/cmda-minor-web/css-to-the-rescue-1920) as part of the [minor Web Development](https://github.com/cmda-minor-web) at the [Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences](https://www.cmd-amsterdam.nl/) I created this page showing information on the camps you'll pass when climbing the Mount Everest. As part of the assignment I was bound to some restrictions.
- JavaScript is not allowed.
- Use of classes is not allowed. We have to work with the so called *selector first strategy*. This means that you have to use a wide variety of CSS selectors.

### Learning Goals
The learning goals for this assignment were:
- You understand the broader scope of CSS: You can show that CSS can be used for more than just styling web pages.
- You understand the progressive enhancement parts of CSS: You can show that you can use the cascade, inheritance and specificity in your project.
- You understand the interactive parts of CSS: Is the UX fully enhanced within in given CSS scope.
- You have been experimenting: Have the learning goals been stretched?

## Context
We needed to chose a different context to which the page will adapt.
The context chosen for my page is the dark-mode.

Below you can see the difference as implemented:
### Dark Mode

### Light Mode

I chose to add a print stylesheet as well.

## Additional restrictions
- I chose not to use any square, circular or triangular shapes, but later on I cheated when adding the buttons and text fields, since I didn't think it would help these functional elements to be interpreted well.
- The design also responds to time/weather, which can be changed at the top of the mountain by clicking on the flag.

## Explored properties
- scroll-behavior
- overflow
- cursor
- animation (and keyframes)
- z-index
