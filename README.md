# Climbing the Mount Everest
As an assignment for the course css to the rescue as part of the minor Web Development at the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences I created this page showing information on the camps you'll pass when climbing the Mount Everest. As part of the assignment I was bound to some restrictions.
- JavaScript is not allowed.
- Use of classes is not allowed. We have to work with the so called selector first strategy. This means that you have to use a wide variety of CSS selectors.

### Learning Goals
The learning goals for this assignment were:
- You understand the broader scope of CSS: You can show that CSS can be used for more than just styling web pages.
- You understand the progressive enhancement parts of CSS: You can show that you can use the cascade, inheritance and specificity in your project.
- You understand the interactive parts of CSS: Is the UX fully enhanced within in given CSS scope.
- You have been experimenting: Have the learning goals been stretched?

## Context
We needed to chose a different context to which the page will adapt.
The context chosen for my page is the dark-mode.

Below you can see the difference as implemented:
### Dark Mode

### Light Mode
