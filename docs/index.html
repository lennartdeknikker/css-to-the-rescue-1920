          <p class="info">
            A cold, white moon rises from below, but you hardly glance at it or
            even the bright twinkle of Universe above. The adrenaline keeps your
            body moving. And then, suddenly, after hours and hours of despair,
            you notice a thin blue beam of light at the horizon. Sunrise! If you
            are lucky, now is the time for the fabled mountain ghost. The
            mountain projects itself onto the morning fog. The shadow towers in
            front of you like a giant mirage. Beneath lies the world in all its
            glory, glowing in the rising sun. You feel the warmth and all hope
            returning.

          <p class="info">
            Camp 4 sits on a plateau resembling a moonscape. You are at the edge
            of the atmosphere and the sky owns a strange, dark blue color. It is
            surely the closest you can get to space on earth. Only a small climb
            above camp, you look down the Tibetan plateau with it's vast brown
            plains, white glaciers and the other alpine giants - Kanchenjunga,
            Lhotse, Makalu -in the distance. It's all magic and unreal.

          <p class="info">
            Imagine sliding a fun, icy slope on a sunny winter's day. Only this
            one is 1200 meter (4000 ft) high. This is not a place to play. The
            dangerous part is to hang on to rope of dubious strength and to
            change carabiners between the ropes. You might feel not too clear in
            your head, especially upon coming down, but it's crucial to
            concentrate. One slip and you are gone, far higher up than you had
            intended really.

          </h1>
          <p class="info">
            This is a vast, flat area of endless snow, deep crevasses and
            mountain walls frequently washed by avalanches. Here we set up camp
            1. At night we listen to the deep, murmuring cracking sounds under
            our tents. It is the crevasses opening and closing deep down in the
            glacier beneath. You keep your fingers crossed that it won't happen
            right under your tent. At least not just now, while you are in it.
            Pounding headaches torture you. But it is here that for the first
            time, just a few steps around a corner, we gain first close sight of
            Everest.
